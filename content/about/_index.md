Little Sun Farm leases land in Gresham, OR and was established in 2019 by Reiden Gustafson. In 2015 Reiden went back to school to study agriculture and organic farming out of a desire to grow food on a larger scale than just her front yard. By supporting Little Sun Farm, you are also supporting a more sustainable form of agriculture. At the farm, we not only care deeply about human health. but also about the land and its inhabitance. 

- NO synthetic pesticides or fertilizers used on the farm.... EVER
- Reduced-tillage practices and ground cover to promote a healthy soil ecosystem
- Cover cropping
- Crop rotation
- Pollinator habitat
