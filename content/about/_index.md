Little Sun Farm grows salad greens and other mixed vegetables on a third of an acre and sells produce at farmers markets in the Portland metro area. The farm leases land at the Headwaters, an incubator farm owned by the East Multnomah Soil and Water Conservation District. 

Little Sun Farm is owned and managed by Reiden Gustafson, who was born in Oregon and grew up mostly in the Pacific Northwest. The name Little Sun comes from one of Reidenâ€™s Pueblo Indian clan names. In addition to an agriculture degree from OSU and an organic farming certificate from Clackamas Community College, Reiden has also worked on a few different organic vegetable farms here in Oregon.
