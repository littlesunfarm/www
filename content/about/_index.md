Little Sun Farm, LLC grows diversified vegetables on less than one acre and sells at two farmers markets in the Portland metro area. The farm is currently part of the Headwaters Incubator Program in Gresham, OR, a program helping small farming businesses by providing access to land and infrastructure. Little Sun Farm is a female and Native-owned business run by Reiden Gustafson. Reiden is part Laguna Pueblo from New Mexico and the name Little Sun comes from one of her family’s clan names. 

Before starting the farm in 2019, Reiden completed an Agriculture Sciences degree from Oregon State University and an Organic Farming certificate program from Clackamas Community College. While not certified organic, Little Sun Farm is committed to following common organic methods. Some of these include cover cropping, crop rotation, the use of row cover, and zero synthetic pesticides.
