  Meet Reiden, one of the newest farmers at Headwaters Incubator Program run by the East Multnomah Soil and Water Conservation District. Reiden was born on the Oregon coast and has spent most of her life in the Pacific Northwest. After working for a local staffing agency as a recruiter,she decided to pursue her interest in agriculture by returning to school. Reiden now has a bachelor's in Agriculture Sciences from Oregon State University as well as an Organic Farming Certificate from Clackamas Community College. Before starting Little Sun Farm, Reiden worked as an intern at two different vegetable farms in Oregon and also sold produce from her home garden at farmers markets in Portland.

  Reiden loves the process of watching and interacting with food as it's grown from seed, harvested, and finally sold at market. She also readily embraces the opportunity that farming gives her to trace her Pueblo Indian roots. The name Little Sun comes from the Laguna Pueblo clan name of Reiden's great-grandfather. Reiden is proud to be following in the footsteps of her Pueblo family who in addition to raising sheep, also had a thriving garden full of cucumbers, corn, peas, turnips, peppers, and the family favorite, cilantro.  Whenever Reiden visits her family's New Mexico village she enjoys listening to her grandmother tell stories about how her mother grew all of their family's food.
